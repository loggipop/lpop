# ‚ö†Ô∏è DEPRECATED: lpop has moved to @loggipop/lpop

This package has been deprecated and moved to the `@loggipop` organization scope.

## Migration Instructions

1. **Uninstall the old package:**
   ```bash
   npm uninstall -g lpop
   ```

2. **Install the new scoped package:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @loggipop/lpop
   ```

The `lpop` command will continue to work exactly the same with the new package.

## Why the move?

- **Security**: Scoped packages reduce the risk of typosquatting attacks
- **Organization**: All packages are now properly organized under the `@loggipop` scope
- **Professionalism**: Scoped packages provide better namespace management
